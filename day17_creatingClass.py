class User:
    pass

user_1 = User()
user_1.id = "218"
user_1.name = "Kabir"

print(user_1.name)

# user_2 = User()
# user_2.id = "219"
# user_2.name = "nabil"
# print(user_2.id)

# this is okay but if there is more than 100 of users then it will make complexity
# so , overcome this complexity and make the code more easier we will use constructor...
